# what is it?
Unspoken is an addon which replaces types of controls with short 3d sounds. So, instead of hearing link, button etc after a control, you will hear a sound at the same time as the control text is spoken, thereby increasing your efficiency. Also, the sound will be played at the position the control is situated on the screen, helping you understand the app layout. This works best with headphones.
I took over development from Sean Tolstoievski to modernize the addon for newer NVDA versions.
#known issues
3d positioning doesn't work on the web. Sounds work, but they all play in the center.
# building
zip the contents of the addon folder and change the extension to .nvda-addon
# future developments
I don't have much time to devote to this, I am going to do the minimum to keep it working it in future NVDA versions. Pull requests welcome!
